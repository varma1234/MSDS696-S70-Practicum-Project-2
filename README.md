# **A Data-Driven Multimodal Analysis of Student Attendance, Engagement, and Behavioral Factors Influencing Academic Success**

##  **Project Summary**

This project explores how attendance, engagement, behavioral patterns, emotional well-being, and resilience collectively influence academic success in higher education. By merging multiple datasets into a unified analytical file, the project identifies early indicators of academic risk and highlights the factors that most strongly predict student performance.
The purpose of this project is simple: **help educators identify at-risk students earlier and make more informed, data-driven decisions that support student success.**

##  **Project Purpose**

Educational institutions often struggle to detect academic risk early enough to intervene. This project uses data-driven methods to:

* Understand key drivers of academic performance
* Identify patterns linked to low scores or disengagement
* Build predictive models to flag students who may need support
* Provide insights that can guide early intervention strategies

The work offers practical value to teachers, administrators, academic advisors, and educational researchers.


##  **Key Insights**

Some of the most important findings from the analysis include:

* **Attendance rate and class engagement are the strongest predictors** of academic performance.
* **Higher stress levels paired with low resilience scores** are early indicators of risk.
* Students with **consistent homework completion** and hands-on participation show significantly higher academic success.
* Machine learning models demonstrate that academic risk can be predicted with meaningful accuracy using combined behavioral and SEL features.

These insights show the power of integrating behavioral, academic, and emotional data into a single predictive framework.


##  **Methodology**

This project follows a clear and structured data science workflow:

1. **Data Collection & Integration**

   * Combined attendance, performance, homework, engagement, mental health, and resilience datasets.

2. **Data Cleaning & Feature Engineering**

   * Removed duplicates, handled missing values, standardized formats, and created new analytical features.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

   * Identified trends, correlations, and behavioral patterns affecting outcomes.

4. **Model Development**

   * Built baseline machine learning models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM, etc.).
   * Evaluated models for accuracy, precision, and early-risk detection capability.

5. **Key Visualizations**
